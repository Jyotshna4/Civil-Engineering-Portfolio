# 🏗 Steel Structure Modeling & Load Analysis – STAAD.Pro

##  Overview
This project involves the modeling and load analysis of a steel beam-and-plate structure using **STAAD.Pro Connect Edition**.  
The analysis applies **dead loads** (self-weight) and **live loads** (uniform plate loads, point loads) to simulate realistic industrial conditions.  
The results include **support reactions**, **bending moments**, **shear forces**, **axial loads**, and **deflections**.

## 🎯Objectives
- Model a beam-and-plate steel structure in STAAD.Pro
- Apply dead loads (self-weight) and live loads
- Define load combinations (DL+LL)
- Calculate structural responses: reactions, moments, shear, axial loads, deflections
- Verify stability for industrial facility applications

## 🛠 Tools Used
- STAAD.Pro Connect Edition
